# Clang Build Analyzer [![Build Status](https://github.com/aras-p/ClangBuildAnalyzer/workflows/build_and_test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/aras-p/ClangBuildAnalyzer/actions)

Clang C/C++ build analysis tool when using Clang 9+ `-ftime-trace`. The `-ftime-trace` compiler flag
(see [Aras' blog post](https://aras-p.info/blog/2019/01/16/time-trace-timeline-flame-chart-profiler-for-Clang/) or
[Clang 9 release notes](https://releases.llvm.org/9.0.0/tools/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.html#new-compiler-flags)) can be useful
to figure out what takes time during compilation of *one* source file. This tool helps to aggregate time trace
reports from multiple compilations, and output "what took the most time" summary:

- Which files are slowest to parse? i.e. spend time in compiler lexer/parser front-end
- Which C++ templates took the most time to instantiate?
- Which files are slowest to generate code for? i.e. spend time in compiler backend doing codegen and optimizations
- Which functions are slowest to generate code for?
- Which header files are included the most in the whole build, how much time is spent parsing them, and what are the include chains of them?


### Usage

1. **Start the build capture (optional)**: `ClangBuildAnalyzer --start <artifacts_folder>`<br/>
   This will write current timestamp in a `ClangBuildAnalyzerSession.txt` file under the given `artifacts_folder`. The artifacts
   folder is where the compiled object files (and time trace report files) are expected to be produced by your build.
1. **Do your build**. Does not matter how; an IDE build, a makefile, a shell script, whatever. As long as it invokes
   Clang and passes `-ftime-trace` flag to the compiler (**Clang 9.0 or later is required** for this).
1. **Stop the build capture**: `ClangBuildAnalyzer --stop <artifacts_folder> <capture_file>`<br/>
   This will find all Clang time trace compatible `*.json` files (Clang `-ftime-trace` produces one JSON file next to each object file)
   under the given `artifacts_folder` that were modified during the session if
   `--start` step was done or all of them if not, and smashes them together into
   one big `capture_file`.
1. **Run the build analysis**: `ClangBuildAnalyzer --analyze <capture_file>`<br/>
   This will read the `capture_file` produced by `--stop` step, calculate the slowest things and print them. If a
   `ClangBuildAnalyzer.ini` file exists in the current folder, it will be read to control how many of various things to print.


### Analysis Output

The analysis output will look something like this:

*** Expensive headers:

112344 ms: Runtime/BaseClasses/BaseObject.h (included 729 times, avg 154 ms), included via:

103856 ms: Runtime/Threads/ReadWriteLock.h (included 478 times, avg 217 ms), included via:

  Runtime_BaseClasses_1.o MonoUtility.h ScriptingProfiler.h  (418 ms)
  ...
```

Granularity and amount of most expensive things (files, functions, templates, includes) that are reported can be controlled by having an
`ClangBuildAnalyzer.ini` file in the working directory. Take a look at [`ClangBuildAnalyzer.ini`](/ClangBuildAnalyzer.ini) for an example.


### Building it

* Windows: Visual Studio 2017 solution at `projects/vs2017/ClangBuildAnalyzer.sln`.
* Mac: Xcode 9.x project at `projects/xcode/ClangBuildAnalyzer.xcodeproj`.
* Linux: Makefile for gcc (tested with 5.4), build with `make -f projects/make/Makefile`.


### Limitations

* Does not capture anything related to linking (or LTO, I guess) right now.
* I haven't tried running it on _huge_ builds; largest I ran was several thousand compiler invocations; and
  the analysis step runs in about 10 seconds on that. I haven't tried on something ginormous like a Chrome build;
  I expect some of my lazy code might not scale to that (I do have one `O(N^2)` place... yeah yeah, I know, shame on
  me).
